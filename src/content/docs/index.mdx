## Description
 
**ARA** stands for *Awesome Rust Algorithms*. These articles are 90% generated using AI. We believe that AI is a cultural revolution. We know, generative AI becomes more, for every release. Soon people will realize the value of AI generated content is as good as the one created by experts.
