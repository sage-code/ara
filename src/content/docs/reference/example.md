We try to create good and comprehensive resources using AI but also we write articles manually. Some of these articles contain pictures, diagrams and code examples created before AI revolution. Visit our resources and evaluate. We hope this helps you enter in tech or bust your career.

## Internal Resources

These resources are created by Sage-Code and distributed on Internet. You can use these resources to learn more topics about computer science, software engineering and programming. Follow these resources and spread the word to support us.

* [Software Engineering Course](https://cse.sagecode.net)
* [Programming Languages Course](https://csp.sagecode.net)

## External Resources

I have ask Bard to give me some cool references as we know Bard do not always have up to date information. Some of these references may not work. If you verify these references and find errors, please report on Discord or on GitHub so we can fix the links.
