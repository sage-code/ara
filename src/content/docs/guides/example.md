This is a minimal example for a new article. It contains paragraphs, headers, and code.
Use this document to start a new article. We do not use advanced features of Astro, just MD files.

# Header h1

Usually we do not use h1. It is reserved for title of the page

## Header h2

This is the most used and it shows on the right side of the pages.

### Code Example

I have not used h3 for anything yet but is reserved to be used.

**This is code in Python**

```python
# message print
for i in range(1,3):
   print("hello world")
```

**This is code in Rust**

```rust
fn test () {
   printf("test");
}
```

There is more to learn about markup language you should read the guide before start to contribute. It is important to know there are limitations of this theme. Not all languages are supported. However, the content is generated by Bard or other AI that create these documents automatically.

## Quotes

Using quotes is more rare but here is one that I like.
