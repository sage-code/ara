In statistics, a **statistic** refers to a **summary of a collection of data**. It can be a single number, like the mean or median, or a more elaborate summary like a histogram or scatter plot. 

Think of it like this: statistics are tools we use to extract meaningful information from large amounts of data. They help us understand the data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.

## Statistic Purpose

For programmers specifically, statistics are crucial for various tasks such as:

* **Data analysis:** Analyzing large datasets to identify trends, correlations, and patterns.
* **Machine learning:** Building predictive models and algorithms based on statistical analysis.
* **Data visualization:** Creating effective visualizations to communicate complex data insights.
* **Performance optimization:** Optimizing algorithms and systems by analyzing performance data.
* **Data validation:** Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of collected data.

Understanding statistics gives programmers a powerful toolset for working with data effectively.

## Algorithms

There are many different algorithms used in statistics, each with its own specific purpose and application. Here's an overview of some common algorithms:

**Descriptive Statistics:**

* **Mean/Average:** Calculates the sum of all values divided by the number of values. Used to find the central tendency of a dataset.
* **Median:** Arranges all values in ascending order and picks the middle value (or the average of two middle values for even numbers). Used to find the central tendency when data is skewed.
* **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value in a dataset. Useful for identifying common values.
* **Standard deviation/ Variance:** Measures the spread of data around the mean. Higher values indicate greater dispersion.
* **Correlation coefficient:** Measures the linear relationship between two variables. Useful for identifying relationships between variables.

**Hypothesis Testing:**

* **t-test:** Compares the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically different.
* **ANOVA:** Compares the means of three or more groups to determine if they are statistically different.
* **Chi-squared test:** Tests for independence between two categorical variables.

**Regression Analysis:**

* **Linear regression:** Fits a straight line to a set of data points to identify the relationship between two variables.
* **Logistic regression:** Classifies data points into two or more categories based on their features.
* **K-nearest neighbors:** Classifies data points based on the class of their closest neighbors.

**Machine Learning:**

* **Decision trees:** Classifies data points by making a series of yes/no decisions based on the values of their features.
* **Support vector machines:** Creates a hyperplane that separates data points into two or more categories.
* **Random forest:** Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
* **Naive Bayes:** Classifies data points based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption of independence between features.
* **K-means clustering:** Groups data points into clusters based on their similarities.

**Others:**

* **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** Analyzes the frequency content of a signal.
* **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm:** Estimates parameters in a statistical model when some data is missing.
* **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC):** Samples from a complex probability distribution.

This is just a small sampling of the many algorithms used in statistics. The specific algorithms used will depend on the type of data being analyzed and the research question being investigated.

For programmers, understanding the algorithms behind various statistical techniques is crucial for effectively implementing them in code. This allows them to manipulate data, analyze results, and build sophisticated statistical models.

## Statistical Functions

 **Here's a summary of Rust's statistical features, including built-in functions and external libraries:**

**Built-in Functions:**

- **Standard Library:**
    - `std::f64::consts`: Constants like PI, E, TAU.
    - `std::ops`: Basic arithmetic operators, trigonometric functions, exponentiation, logarithms.
- **rand crate:** Random number generation (add to Cargo.toml):
    - `rand::random`: Generate random numbers from various distributions.

**External Libraries:**

- **statrs:** Comprehensive statistics library:
    - descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
    - probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson, etc.)
    - hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.)
    - linear regression and other modeling techniques
- **nalgebra:** Linear algebra and numerical computing:
    - vectors, matrices, linear transformations
- **statrs-dev:** Experimental features, including distributions and hypothesis testing.
- **special:** Special mathematical functions (gamma, beta, Bessel, etc.).

- **Performance:** Consider library efficiency for large datasets or numerical operations.
- **Customization:** Explore library features for tailored statistical analysis.

**Example (Calculating Mean and Standard Deviation):**

```rust
use statrs::statistics::{Mean, StandardDeviation};

let data = vec![1.5, 2.3, 4.1, 3.6];
let mean = Mean::new(&data).unwrap();
let std_dev = StandardDeviation::new(&data, Some(mean)).unwrap();
println!("Mean: {}", mean);
println!("Standard deviation: {}", std_dev);
```

## Made in Rust

 **Here's an explanation of how Rust is self-hosting and examples of statistical functions written in Rust:**

**Self-Hosting Nature:**

- Rust's compiler, `rustc`, is primarily written in Rust itself. This demonstrates the language's maturity and ability to handle complex tasks like compiler development.
- This bootstrapping approach ensures consistency, reliability, and efficiency within the Rust ecosystem.
- It also allows for rapid development and innovation as new features can be added directly to the compiler and standard library in Rust.

**Key Tools for Building Rust in Rust:**

- **Cargo:** Rust's package manager, written in Rust, manages dependencies and builds projects.
- **rustup:** The Rust toolchain installer, also written in Rust, manages Rust versions and components.

**Statistical Functions in Rust:**

- **Standard Library:**
    - `std::f64::consts`: Provides mathematical constants like PI and E.
    - `std::ops`: Offers basic arithmetic operations, including exponentiation and logarithms.
- **External Libraries:**
    - **statrs:** Comprehensive library for descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and more.
    - **nalgebra:** Handles linear algebra operations for statistical modeling and numerical computing.
    - **rand:** Generates random numbers from various distributions for simulations and statistical sampling.

**Example of Statistical Calculations using statrs:**

```rust
use statrs::statistics::{Mean, StandardDeviation};

let data = vec![1.5, 2.3, 4.1, 3.6];
let mean = Mean::new(&data).unwrap();
let std_dev = StandardDeviation::new(&data, Some(mean)).unwrap();
println!("Mean: {}", mean);
println!("Standard deviation: {}", std_dev);
```

**Additional Benefits of Rust for Statistical Computing:**

- **Performance:** Native compilation and memory safety lead to fast and efficient code.
