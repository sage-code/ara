# ARA Project

ARA = Artifficial Research Articles

## Description
Ara is a research project about artificial intelligence. Is a static website generated with AI. We research compiler, high performance computing and other key topics in technology.

## Motivation

The reason for this project is that blog articles generated with AI may be detected by AI detectors and may be blocked in the future. Having a GPL project that is under version control enable many developers to contribute as volunteers and improve upon other's people work.

## Content

This repository contains MD generated content. We are using Astro framework to host generated pages. We are not sure what the content will look like. Probably we will use a similar style like the rest of Sage-Code but using Astro the pages may be a little different.

## Contribution

For contribution you must be member of Sage-Code organization on Discord. Anyone can submit a PR but only designated code maintainers from core team may merge these contributions. Another for of contribution is to participate to debates and discussions on Discord.
